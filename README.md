# Rootkits Demonstration for Linux

## About
A rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed.
Rootkits are particularly dangerous because they are designed to hide their presence on your device. 
Rootkit is able to hide processes, files and grant root privileges. It also have stealth mode (enabled by default) that prevents it from detecting.

# Disclaimer
As a student who likes the field of security, I always wondered how one could programmatically implement these tools. These tools are a simple, well designed codes for anyone who is purely interested in the educational part only!! 

Therefore, I bear no responsibility, in case someone, somehow, uses this tool, for any malicious purposes. 

keep learning.
